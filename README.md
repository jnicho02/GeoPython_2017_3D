# GeoPython_2017_3D
This repository contains the material used in the workshop "Working with 3D point clouds with Python" from GeoPython 2017.

For the workshop, participants will need:

Python 2.7: you can get with different installations such as PythonXY* (https://python-xy.github.io/downloads.html) or Anaconda** (https://www.continuum.io/downloads) 

*Only for Windows
**Windows, Linux and MAC

Note: PythonXY already comes with most packages needed for the workshop. With Anaconda, most of them must be installed manually. If you don't know how to install packages in Anaconda, please check this link (https://conda.io/docs/using/pkgs.html).

Packages needed in this workshop are the following:
	Numpy,
	Scipy,
	Gdal,
	Mayavi,
	Laspy,
	matplotlib,
	PIL

In addition, we will use a 3D point cloud viewer (LAS files). Quick Terrain Reader (http://appliedimagery.com/download/) will be used during the workshop but feel free	to use any software that can show LAS files.

Last but not least, QGIS will be used (http://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html) to visualize the products we will generate during the workshop.

The sample data that will be used during the course can be downloaded in this link (https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ibowwrcu98ab6vb/AACWmCjX53yJd5hNrwqRY7BLa?dl=0)

In case there are any question, contact me at any time.

See you soon in Basel!!
